Ichika Anon from BanG Dream! MyGO!!!!!, an anime girl with long, straight pink hair cascading past her shoulders and bright blue eyes, stands bathed in stage lighting. She's holding a light seafoam green electric guitar, which looks like an ESP model (the logo 'ESP' is visible on the black strap and the headstock). She wears a stylish blue zip-up jacket with ruffled details over a dark top, paired with a short white pleated skirt and a simple black choker. A confident, slightly playful smile is on her face as she looks directly forward. The camera angle is slightly low, emphasizing her presence on what appears to be a dimly lit stage, with strong spotlights creating lens flares and highlighting her figure against the dark background. She lightly strums the guitar as the shot holds. --h 320 --w 544 --d 1026 --g 5 --s 20 --f 73 --i toml/1.jpg
